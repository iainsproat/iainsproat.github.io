title: Auto-Update and construction document management

A perennial problem in construction is the use of out-of-date drawings during construction.  It is not uncommon for the contractor, or an operative within the supply chain, to begin work using information that has already been superseded.  Mostly the problem is spotted and corrected before the contractor has gone too far, but it inevitably leads to additional costs and headache of varying degrees nonetheless.  This problem is not limited to the contractor, but is also prevalent between the various consultants during the building design process - the engineer may be designing the structure based on recently superseded architectural drawings.

The software industry suffers from a similar problem of trying to ensure that its customers are using the latest versions of its software.  This is not a desire to gain more money by selling updates but is a necessity to fix security vulnerabilities.  There may be a weakness in a software package which can be exploited by the nefarious.  Software developers will, of course, work hard to reduce these vulnerabilities but some do slip through the net, just as oversights and errors can still appear on architectural or engineering drawings.  The ethical software developer, as with architects and engineers, will work hard to resolve these errors when they are brought to attention, and produce an updated version of the software or drawing.

Microsoft suffers from this problem with its Internet Explorer (IE) web browser.  The following chart shows that despite the latest versions of Internet Explorer being available, a significant proportion of its customers still use long superseded versions.  This is despite Microsoft providing updates for free, and encouraging uptake.

I would hazard a guess that the usage of different versions on most construction sites, and between most consultants in the design process, follows a similar pattern.  The use of electronic document control systems throughout the construction industry will have improved upon this in recent years.  Unfortunately, most workflows and company processes will still require files to be downloaded and saved outside of such systems, or even printed.  It is much harder to correctly manage documents saved in manually administered folders, either electronic or paper.  The nightmare is the unmanaged drawing tucked inside an operatives toolbox or lying on a desk.

In comparison to Microsoft's Internet Explorer, the usage of different versions of Google's Chrome browser is in stark contrast.  Almost all of Google's customers are using the latest version almost immediately after its launch.  This represents near nirvana for version control.  Google have achieved this by incorporating a clever tool inside of Chrome which automatically checks with Google as to whether there is a new version. Should a new version be found it automatically downloads and installs it.  The next time the user opens Google Chrome they are using the latest version.  In most cases the user is aware this has happened.

However, there remains a fundamental difference between updating web browsers and updating documents.  Construction documents are used as the *basis* of ongoing work, and changes to this basis can have fundamental effects in almost all terms - time, cost, contractual obligations and technical implications.  It is therefore imperative that the recipient of a new version is aware that a change has been made, and that the change is highlighted.  In addition, the creator of the new version should try and anticipate the likely impact, or request prior consultatation, so that they can make the recipient aware.  The recipient also needs to evaluate the impact of any changes and act accordingly, one of the outcomes of this may be to reject the change.

It is here that the process of negotiation and resolution must occur in order to continue making progress with the construction project.  Assuming this can be achieved, and the new version of the document agreed, then there is a technical challenge in ensuring that this document is distributed to all.

I can see a future of e-paper and portable devices making huge impacts into this problem.  The grubby drawing stashed in the toolbox is replaced with a foldable electronic paper device which automatically checks with the contractor's central server and updates the versions of the drawings it has stored, ready for the next mornings work.  Perhaps it may even download some advice on how to handle the change, or a request for the operative to speak to her supervisor first.
